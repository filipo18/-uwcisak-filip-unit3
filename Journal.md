-------- 
We stared with python. Puting numbers in order was a bit of a challange for me but I got it preatty quick.

Feb 3
-----
All the programing questioons were easier than puting numbers in order. I finnsihed all of them really quick. And I like python so much more than every other lanugage we used till now.

Feb 5

Today's to do list:
1. We looked at computational thinking. Computational thinking consists of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking
1. Make program in python that finds bigest prime factor of 10 numbers enetered
1. Come up with inventory systems we need, and pick developer and client. I need to develop instrument inventory system for Tom


I learned how to use functions / libraries in python and it is really usefull. I think everything was preatty celar so I don't have any questions today

Feb 11
-------
Today's to do list:
1. Client - developer interviews
1. Start coding secure login system

Client - developer interviews went bad. People were not prepared and they didn't even know what they want. We were just loosing time with that probably for one hour. After that we started coding encrypted login part of the program. I never really undesrtood basic priciple of how login can be secure. Now when we coded it, it actually makes sense. This was interesting for me because it was kinda related to the topic of my EE.


Feb 17
--------
Today's to do list:
1. Have client interviews to figgure out exactly what they want
1. Work on our repository to finnish criteriaA.md file

I didn't mannage to finnish criteriaA.md file, so I will work on that later. Client requirements still pretty unclear. I will talk to client as I start developing inventory so client can keep track of work progress.

Today's to do list:
1. Quick coding competition in 3 groups
1. Short kahoot about python 
1. Create simmple bank inventory

Using functions is big part of pythong. I was super uncomfotable using them in Arduino C, but now using python I feel like I am getting better and better. I found python inbuild commands super usefull, but I am not used to the way they let you solve problems, so I will really work on getting better at using functions like map, reduce and filter. Making bank inventory was good practise for using fucntions.

Homework for this week was unusally short. I finnished it preatty qucik and questions were relatively simple. The bigest problem common to all questions we got was how to import given numbers in list of integers. I couldn't solve that on my own so I googled for solution and found it. After that everything was easy, but I still don't uderstnd the import part. I need to ask that Dr. Ruben in class. a = [int(i) for i in input().split()] 

Feb 24

Today's to do list:
1. Started working on object oriented programing OOP
1. Work on graphing with python

I learned a bit about OOP - how to use classes. I went over few pages of theory and it is a lot to process at once. I think I will get the hang of it by using it more. Last 3 revise questions on the handout Dr. Ruben gave us were pretty confusing. I din't uderstand what I need to do. I will ask in next class. Also it is prety consuing when you use self. something to call argument and when you don't.

Mar 3
-----
I showed my sketched designes to my customer. Dr. Ruben showed us how to use these sketches in python to create a program with GUI. The whole OOP with classes is still preaty abstract and unclear for me. I don't understand what every line of code is doing in our programs. WE finnished simpe currency exchange program.

Dr. Ruben is absend this week, we got few tasks to complete till monday. I will do that on the weekend,  becasue now I need to study for some tests I have this week

Mar 7
------
I started working on homework we had this week. More about my expirinece with it can be found in root of my repository in file CodinGamePuzzles.md I dind't finish today, I got annoyed by last problem. I will try to finnish it tomorrow. In general, tasks are not to hard. The most confusig part for me is to uderstand inputs, reqirements and outputs. When I figure that out the rest is realtvely easy.

Mar 8

I finished with the last task from the homework.

Apr 2
------
Tasks:
1. Showing all the windows and coding button behavior in my Inventory program
1. Add all that to the repository
1. Go thorough the database video and decide if I will do that or do the coding tasks from the homework

Because I had some problems with debuging in last class in school, I was a bit behind on the development. So today I watched videos on showing dialog windows and coding button behavior posted a while ago in the classroom. I learnd how to open dialog windows from the mainappwindow and how to code some logic into the buttons. Now every button in mainappwindow is working and first login page takes us to registration page if we click registration button. I also learned how to code some logic to the buttons. I spent too much time on that, because of some debuging issiues I had (I needed to fix windows in QTDesigner, but I didn't see changes in my app. It turns out that file names were differet than I tought they were so I ended up fixing window in QTDesinger at least 5 times, and than converting it to py fille in terminal. But because of different names I was not conerting fixed files. It took me a while to figure out what's happening, debuging process is always so frustrating :-(
Because this is first week of online classes everyone is still a bit confused and figuring things out, so somehow I ended up having almost all of my classes every day of this week, so I was a bit bussy and this is all I did for CS. I watched the databases video I will probably code them tomorrow. I will also start with syllabus and coding questions tomorrow and I hope I will finnish them. If not I definetly need to do them over the weekend!

Apr 5

Tasks:
1. Answer the syllabus questions
1. Do the coding tasks

From syllabus the new thing I learned is what is memory data registar. I did't actually study anything from the sylabus I just ctrl+f in the files for the thing the question was asking for. 

**HL question**
I learned how to plot graph from csv file... at least I thought I did. Then I opened total_cases.csv file and I was conused. I was trying to make graph for some time and then I gave up. Just before I started writing this journal the idea appeared in my head I went back check total_cases.csv file again and I understod what it means. I think I know what I need to do now. First row lists all the countries. Then in each row number of total cases matches position of the country for the first row. So I create a list of every second element in every row. This will be number of total cases. Than I find my country and do the same. Then I just plot both curves. I need to do this tomorrow.

I have few questions about creating graphs but I will google about that tomorrow and try to solve HL Question.

Apr 7
------
Tasks:
1. Finish with HL question
1. Do the showing data in database development part

I didn't work on the syllabus today.
I  have no more questions about the HL Question. I solved it. I spend some time debuging it because of 2 causes: **1.** When I append atgument from a row to a list, I need to change it to int(). It took me some time to figure that out. **2.** Number of total cases is around 300.000, and number of total cases in Slovenia is around 300. So when I ploted graph for total cases in Slovenia I just saw a straing line so I thought my program was not working. When I figured out it can be a scale problem I ploted line for Italy on the same graph and I saw that my program is actually wokrking.

I learned how to show .csv file in the table. 

I don't totally understand what is ```i, row``` in  ```for i, row in enumerate(file):``` doing. What do 2 things separated with comma do in for loop?

Apr 14
-------
Tasks:
1. DO the coding tasks
1. Do the syllabus question
1. Continue develpoment on the Inventroy app

I did not learn anything new with the conding tasks. I finnished them preaty quickly. I don't know what to to about the scale of axes. Because number of Covid-19 cases is so high I dont even seet the change in price of gold. 

I did the syllabus questionn. I did not learn anything new. I did not use the syllabus resources. I just do quick google searches on few components. I know what they do in practise, I just checked on google how to put that in words

I made registration and log in methods. I didn't really learn anything new. We already did encrypting part few months ago in school so I just remembered how this is done. Everyting else that needed coding is basically using what we already know. But I noticed when the inventory develpment goes on, I am geting more and more understanding on python. I was super confused with classes and methods at the benining but now, although I still feel a bit uncomoftable with them, I think I understand what I am doing much better.

Apr 19
------
1. Complete development file from last week
2. Do this weeks tasks

Questions from this weeks homework:
1.How do i increse number of bycicles every time by 1 when new bycicle is created
1.How do I set default value in this class for atribute from parent class
1.How do i create a list that stores the objects of bicycles and mountain bikes created

I did not study syllabus this week. I refreshed some of my basic knowledge about OOP
