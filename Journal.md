-------- 
We stared with python. Puting numbers in order was a bit of a challange for me but I got it preatty quick.

All the programing questioons were easier than puting numbers in order. I finnsihed all of them really quick. And I like python so much more than every other lanugage we used till now.

Today's to do list:
1. We looked at computational thinking. Computational thinking consists of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking
1. Make program in python that finds bigest prime factor of 10 numbers enetered
1. Come up with inventory systems we need, and pick developer and client. I need to develop instrument inventory system for Tom


I learned how to use functions / libraries in python and it is really usefull. I think everything was preatty celar so I don't have any questions today

Today's to do list:
1. Client - developer interviews
1. Start coding secure login system

Client - developer interviews went bad. People were not prepared and they didn't even know what they want. We were just loosing time with that probably for one hour. After that we started coding encrypted login part of the program. I never really undesrtood basic priciple of how login can be secure. Now when we coded it, it actually makes sense. This was interesting for me because it was kinda related to the topic of my EE.

Today's to do list:
1. Have client interviews to figgure out exactly what they want
1. Work on our repository to finnish criteriaA.md file

I didn't mannage to finnish criteriaA.md file, so I will work on that later. Client requirements still pretty unclear. I will talk to client as I start developing inventory so client can keep track of work progress.

Today's to do list:
1. Quick coding competition in 3 groups
1. Short kahoot about python 
1. Create simmple bank inventory

Using functions is big part of pythong. I was super uncomfotable using them in Arduino C, but now using python I feel like I am getting better and better. I found python inbuild commands super usefull, but I am not used to the way they let you solve problems, so I will really work on getting better at using functions like map, reduce and filter. Making bank inventory was good practise for using fucntions.

Homework for this week was unusally short. I finnished it preatty qucik and questions were relatively simple. The bigest problem common to all questions we got was how to import given numbers in list of integers. I couldn't solve that on my own so I googled for solution and found it. After that everything was easy, but I still don't uderstnd the import part. I need to ask that Dr. Ruben in class. a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

Today's to do list:
1. Started working on object oriented programing OOP
1. Work on graphing with python

I learned a bit about OOP - how to use classes. I went over few pages of theory and it is a lot to process at once. I think I will get the hang of it by using it more. Last 3 revise questions on the handout Dr. Ruben gave us were pretty confusing. I din't uderstand what I need to do. I will ask in next class. Also it is prety consuing when you use self. something to call argument and when you don't.

I showed my sketched designes to my customer. Dr. Ruben showed us how to use these sketches in python to create a program with GUI. The whole OOP with classes is still preaty abstract and unclear for me. I don't understand what every line of code is doing in our programs. WE finnished simpe currency exchange program.

Dr. Ruben is absend this week, we got few tasks to complete till monday. I will do that on the weekend,  becasue now I need to study for some tests I have this week

Mar 7

I started working on homework we had this week. More about my expirinece with it can be found in root of my repository in file CodinGamePuzzles.md I dind't finish today, I got annoyed by last problem. I will try to finnish it tomorrow. In general, tasks are not to hard. The most confusig part for me is to uderstand inputs, reqirements and outputs. When I figure that out the rest is realtvely easy.

Mar 8
------
I finished with the last task from the homework.
