### Client
I am going to the supermarket every week so I possess quite a lot of food. But unfortunately someone in my house keeps stealing it. So I want a system to keep track of food I buy and then use. Food can be located in a fridge or in a shelves. I want to be able to add the new food easily, log the name of it, the location where it's stored, add expiration date and quantity. Then when I use it I want to log date of last usage and amount used. At the end, when there is no food anymore, I want to delete it from inventory. It is important that I am the only person accessing my food inventory.
