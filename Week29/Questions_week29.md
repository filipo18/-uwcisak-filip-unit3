# Explain the corelation coefficient between price of gold and Covid19 cases
I took data for covid19 cases and for price of gold from january 21st to march 17th. Corelation coefficient between them is 0.19 Which means that numbers are moving in same direction but they are not related enaugh.

# You have been given 5000 USD to build your computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and Explain how they work as a system to create a computer.

### CPU
CPU is most important part of the PC. It handless most of the procesing done while software is runing. It's build from milions and milions of micro transistors. I would buy **RYZEN 5 360x 6 Cores, 12 Threads @3.6GH**. After a lot of years of complete Intel domination, ryzen is bringing some good processors for much lower prices than intel. (about 230$) This is not the most powerfull CPU you can find on the market but I don't see what I would do with more power. Rendering edited video could be faster and that is all. 

### GPU
GPU handles some video output processing, especially when playing video games and delaing with 3D rendering. Some workload is also distributed to it while video editing. I would buy  **EVGA GeForce GTX 1650 SC Ultra Gaming, 4GB GDDR5, Dual Fan, Metal Backplate**. (costs about 180$ on amazon) This GPU is powerfull enaugh to handle some gaming on medium settings. That is almost the only time that I am using GPU. When video editing some workload could be distributed to GPU but that is not always the case (depens on software and configuration you are using).

### CASE
Case holds everything together. The only thing thats is impornat is to have enaugh space to fit everything. I would buy **NZXT H510 - CA-H510B-B1 - Compact ATX Mid-Tower PC Gaming Case - Front I/O USB Type-C Port - Tempered Glass Side Panel - Cable Management System - Water-Cooling Ready - Black** (about 60$) It is a bit overkill for the set up I am building but in case we need more space for any future improvements I thnik this one is not too expensive.


### Motherboard
Motherboard is connectiong all the components in the computer. Its is basically a circuit board. It allows comunication between processing and memory units in the computer. I would buy **ASRock ATX Motherboard (B450 PRO4)** (about 100$$)

### RAM
Ram stores temporary data that CPU is working with. When we take power from it, all the data is lost. When programs are runing, parts of them that compuer is exectuing is stored in RAM. We need to make sure that we have enaugh space on RAM for all the programs we will want to run at the same time. I would buy **Crucial Ballistix 3200 MHz DDR4 DRAM Desktop Gaming Memory Kit 16GB (8GBx2)** (about 80$)

### Storage
This is where all the software and user data is stored. Hard drives can be still used as external drives with user data, but disk where OS and all the programs are stored should be SSD becaue it is much faster than hard drive. I would buy **ADATA SU635 480GB 3D-NAND SATA 2.5 inch Internal SSD** (about 50$)

###  Power supply
The only thing we need to be carefull when buying power suply is that it needs to be capable enaugh to power all the components. Power suplly is transforming current from the outlet to right volatage to power the computer. I would buy **System Power U9 700W, BN 609, 80 Plus Bronze, Power Supply (BN609)** (about 70$)

### Cooling
Cooling is not really needed in my configuration since GPU and CPU already come with its own fans for air cooling.

### Periferals
I think monitor with 1920x1080 resolution and refresh rate 60hz is perfectly fine. After doing some research on good monitors for small amount of money the clear winner was Asus VS278Q-P for about 200$. I woudl also buy keyboard and mouse but I would not spend more than 50$ on both together. I would use headphones I already had.

## ALL TOGETHER
Price of this desktop computer would be around 1000$. It is not the most powerfull computer ever but it is compelatly enaugh for what I am using the computer. It acuatlly has more power than I need, but I don't know how to even use that. Things I do with my computer are not that demanding. So I am left with about 4000$ which I would probably spend on kitesufing trip to Brazil in summer (3 weeks about 1000$). Than I would spend another 1500$ to get skydving license. I would spend another 700$ to go Heli-skiing from Mont Blanc. I would spend the remaing 800$ on skiing trip to Hokaido during the winter break. I that's how I would spend money I would get for my dream computer :-)
