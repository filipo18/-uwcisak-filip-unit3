Design statement
------------------


### Client
I am going to the supermarket every week so I possess quite a lot of food. But unfortunately someone in my house keeps stealing it. So I want a system to keep track of food I buy and then use. Food can be located in a fridge or in a shelves. I want to be able to add the new food easily, log the name of it, the location where it's stored, add expiration date and quantity. Then when I use it I want to log date of last usage and amount used. At the end, when there is no food anymore, I want to delete it from inventory. It is important that I am the only person accessingÂ my food inventory.


### Developer
I am going to design a Guitar Inventory software application for my client including a secured login system. The software application will help my client to reliable track who is using which guitar andthe characteristics of each of this guitars such as type, colour and type of wood.
